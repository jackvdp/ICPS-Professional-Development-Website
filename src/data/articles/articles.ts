    title: 'Micro-Learning: Relevance for the Public Sector',
    description: `Explore microlearning as a cost-effective training option for public sector.`,
    date: '2 Feb 2023',
    content: `
      <p>With the complexities of governance increasing by the day, the public sector has felt an urgent need to adopt a more modern and innovative outlook, especially in its training and development requirements. A large number of employees, the complex nature of the governance along with lack of sufficient funds make it critical for public sector organisations to implement efficient solutions to streamline the task of effective training and development of their employees. In recent years, microlearning has proved to be a promising solution.</p>
<p>While there is no official definition of microlearning, all microlearning-based training has one common characteristic, namely, brevity. It is a method of delivering educational or training content in small, bite-sized pieces that can be easily consumed and retained by learners. While microlearning can take many forms, from videos to immediate feedback to formal feedback at the end of the day, short, targeted online demonstrations or tutorials are the most common. The average length of micro-learning pieces is between 4-5 minutes and represents a movement away from deep attention learning to hyper-learning.</p>
<p>Microlearning is based on the concept of the “forgetting curve” developed by the psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus. It demonstrated that when people take in large amounts of information, retention of what was learned tends to degrade over time. Big data has also played an important role in the development of microlearning. In the age of big data, human’s attention span is decreasing. The vast amount of available information creates a deficit of attention. It is thus necessary to allocate that attention efficiently. This makes microlearning important since it emphasises short learning duration. </p>
<h3>What Are the Benefits of Microlearning?</h3>
<p>Some of the benefits that comes with the adoption of microlearning training methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaced Repetition</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important benefit of microlearning is that it helps counteract the “forgetting curve”. Since Microlearning modules are very short, they are easy to consume again and again over time thus solidifying the knowledge in one’s memory. This allows public sector employees to acquire new knowledge and skills quickly and at their own convenience, without having to take long breaks from their work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Large number of applications</li>
</ul>
<p>Microlearning modules can be used for teaching single topics, for quick reference, or as part of a series of other microlearning programs. The training method can also be used to teach a range of topics, which makes it useful in the public sector where there is often a high turnover rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective Outcomes</li>
</ul>
<p>Microlearning helps learners understand more of any given subject, especially if it’s complicated. This is so because it breaks information down into bite-sized pieces that center around one big idea, allowing the learner to focus without distraction, and put their newfound knowledge into practice immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learner-centred</li>
</ul>
<p>All individuals have different capacities and preferences for learning. Microlearning gives the flexibility to design training sessions that help maximise the learning experience for each individual. Furthermore, these sessions can be delivered in many different forms, such as videos, interactive quizzes, and mobile applications. This makes it a convenient option for a wide range of learners, including those with different learning styles. Employees in the public sector may be spread across a number of different locations. The digital nature of microlearning makes training employees easy, as they can access the training courses as per their convenient time and from any location they may be at.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>Micro-learning content can be consumed in short pieces, making it easy for busy government employees to fit training into their schedules. Also, since microlearning is self-paced, learners have the flexibility to progress through the content at their own convenience. It cuts down on the time needed to establish new policies and reinforce existing ones in public sector organisations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost-effective</li>
</ul>
<p>A microlearning course is much cheaper to produce as compared to traditional long-form training. It can be delivered digitally, which reduces the cost of training materials and makes it easy to access and complete. Furthermore, microlearning is easily scalable and can be used to train large numbers of employees at once, making it a cost-effective solution for government agencies with many employees. In the era of budget cuts in the public sector, microlearning can prove to be a viable cost-effective option for professional learning and development. </p>
<p>Microlearning has been revolutionising employee training and development in the corporate world, but is it applicable to the public sector? </p>
<p>With increasing budget cuts, government agencies must maximise their returns on every pound they spend. Long-form training can be expensive as well as time-consuming. Microlearning, on the other hand, can be consumed virtually anywhere, is delivered quickly, and the results are impressive. This means less time, money, and resources spent on retraining employees in an organisation.</p>
<p>While learning and development functions in the government sector may seem challenging, a streamlined microlearning training process has the potential to provide valuable information to the government employees keeping them in tune with the changing needs of the public sector.</p>
<p>However, microlearning may not be the end all be all of learning and development, as it is sometimes portrayed. This is so because, firstly, it cannot create experts which public sector employees are often required to be. Due to the shortness of its content, microlearning does not have the capacity to delve deep into a particular subject matter.</p>
<p>Also, while basic concepts can be understood with microlearning, complex topics requiring advanced skills, require long-form learning. While it is not impossible it generally requires a lot more effort, defeating the entire purpose of microlearning. Thus, there is room for both forms of training in most public sector organisations. Some subject matter will be suitable for microlearning formats, particularly skills-based training, while for other topics traditional training might be more suitable. However, microlearning is an emerging model of training that can enable public sector employees gain new knowledge or skills just in time to meet their immediate needs in this fast-changing world. </p>

    title: "The 70-20-10 Model for Learning and Development",
    description: `The 70-20-10 rule reveals that individuals tend to learn 70% of their knowledge from challenging experiences and assignments, 20% from developmental relationships, and 10% from coursework and training.`,
    date: '25 Apr 2023',
    content: `
      <p>The ability of an organisation to innovate, change and become more effective is dependent upon the skills and capabilities of its employees, thus highlighting the importance of professional training and development. The 70-20-10 learning model has proved a time-tested solution for organisational learning. Designed to integrate three types of learning (experiential, social and formal), this model has been adopted globally in both the private and public sectors to support organisational learning.</p>
      <p>70 20 10 learning is a ratio of multi-dimensional ways of learning, including experiences, collaboration and training. This ratio describes the ideal combination of different learnings for successful personal and organisational capability development. </p>
      <h3>70-20-10 Explained</h3>
      <p>The model is based upon the principle that a learner needs three types of experiences for effective learning to occur. These include:</p>
<h3>70% (Experiential Learning)</h3>
<p>70% of what we learn is through hands-on experience, resolving daily issues, and challenges. This type of learning is informal and self-directed and requires a learner to apply the skills and theory learned. This exercise helps in better knowledge retention and honing skills that may be lacking.</p>
<h3>20% (Social Learning):</h3>
<p>Learning can also occur when one observes and interacts with other people. Employees learn through their interactions with peers, superiors, or other parties involved in an organisation. This amounts to 20% of the learning according to the model.</p>
<h3>10% (Formal Learning):</h3>
<p>The backbone of organisational learning is formal, which is delivered in a structured way. 10% of the learner’s development occurs through the formal coursework they are exposed to. This gives a base for the knowledge gained.</p>
<p>Reflecting that learning must be tightly coupled with work to enable capability development and learning transfer, organisations should develop a complex training programme that combines formal training with on-the-job training along with opportunities for peer and supervisor support.</p>
<p>Common Misconceptions</p>
<p>The 70-20-10 model is often used as a rigid model; however, it must be remembered that it is only to serve as a guideline and not a fixed rule. Not all learning activities have to fit into one of the three categories, in the exact same ratio. Such an approach will not be as effective for all workers as everyone have their own particular learning needs and styles.</p>
<p>Secondly, the model is not ‘anti-training’. Organisations should not see it as a recommendation to reduce formal training to a mere 10%. It is rather about integrating both formal and informal learning into every aspect of work.</p>
<p>Is the 70-20-10 relevant for the public sector?</p>
<p>Transfer of learning in the public sector is particularly challenging due to high turnover in government, poor succession planning, few opportunities to practice new skills, weak links between training activities and organisational skill requirements, continuous structural change, insufficient resources, and the prioritisation of task output over skill development. The 70-20-10 framework offers a viable solution to such challenges.</p>
<p>The principle underlying the 70-20-10 framework is that learning takes place through combining formal, social, and experiential experiences. Thus, for learning transfer to occur, individuals also need social and experiential support. Social support occurs through working with and gaining support from colleagues. Experiential support, on the other hand, requires the creation of opportunities to apply new skills and knowledge at work. As it combines three types of learning, the 70-20-10 model could guide the public sector in overcoming learning transfer problems. This can be done by ensuring that learning and development programmes include structured experiential, social and formal learning experiences.</p>
<p>What makes the 70-20-10 learning model effective?</p>
<p>There are several benefits of the 70-20-10 model. A few of them include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increases efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>This model offers a combination of different learning approaches, catering to different aspects of work. This leads to enhanced employee engagement and performance leading to a more productive workplace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning model emphasises on-the-job experiences and coordination. Hence, it becomes easier to scale the employees’ performance and growth and compare them providing constructive feedback for further development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning culture</li>
</ul>
<p>The three different types of learning ensure a culture of continuous learning in an organisation. The thrill of learning new skills helps enhance employee performance and improve employee retention rates.</p>
<p>However, the model has been often criticised for providing only 10% weightage to formal learning. Formal training is the vital backbone of organisational training and reducing it might not always be very productive. The model has also been criticised for its order and reversing it to 10-20-70 with formal training coming first has been suggested to be more effective.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The 70-20-10 model is a time-tested globally accepted model of organisational training and development. However, with evolution in available technology, office environment and employees’ learning habits, is it still relevant?</p>
<p>The learning model is still relevant as long as it is not used very rigidly and only as a guideline. The 70-20-10 model is likely to give better results if the ratio is modified according to the specific industry and the kind of learners that the concerned organisation has. Some jobs may need more formal training while some may require more on the job learning. Thus, there must be a balance between the three forms of learning, and formal training can be designed such that it incorporates both on the job training and social learning.</p>
<p>When the learning model’s elements are not perceived to be implemented in isolation but rather in an integrated and complementary manner, this model has the potential to lead to newer opportunities to both develop and implement new capabilities. It is for this reason that the 70:20:10 model is still extensively used across the globe in both private and public sectors as a guideline for training employees.</p>

    title: "Blended Learning Solutions: The Future of Training?",
    description: `Discover how blended learning is transforming professional development for a wider audience, anytime, anywhere.`,
    date: '7 Mar 2023',
    content: `
      <p>With the challenges facing the globe in light of the pandemic, soaring energy costs and international conflict, the need for a well-trained and adept public sector has never been so great. Yet, at the same time, remote working, multi-generational learners and budgetary pressures have made it difficult for many learning and development departments to ensure that their employees are receiving the professional development that their roles require. A number of experts have argued that the answer to these challenges is blended learning.</p>
<h3>What is Blended Learning?</h3>
<p>Andrew Wickham, an expert in professional training, has described blended learning as the delivery of knowledge through the coordinated combination of digital content (e-learning) and live training (face-to-face or video conference). This model of training benefits from allowing learners to determine their own pace, and for being more adaptable and thus suitable for a wider audience.</p>
<h3>Key Elements of Blended Learning</h3>
<p>Blended learning is more than the simple combination of online and physical delivery. Instead, it involves the careful curation of the best elements of physical and online delivery, blended and enhanced by a range of emerging teaching tools.</p>
<p>Face-to-face personal instruction still remains one of the most popular forms of learning around the world, and is a crucial component of the blended learning model. The expertise of the trainer and the human touch involved in classroom-style training is crucial to ensuring that learners develop their knowledge and skills in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>E-learning, by contrast, is quickly becoming one of the most important means of learning today across the world. It constitutes all forms of educational technology from online and virtual education to digital education collaboration and web-based training. E-learning has dramatically improved the accessibility of professional development.</p>
<p>These two are then further enhanced by emerging teaching tools, and particularly those associated with Web 3.0, such as gamification, virtual classrooms, and augmented reality. These tools help bridge the gap between traditional in-person learning and e-learning, with its focus on creativity and user engagement.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Adopting Blended Learning</h3>
<p>In contrast to physical and e-learning, blended learning claims to deliver the best of both of worlds. Its advocates argue that there are three key advantages to this model: cost-effectiveness, flexibility and information retention.</p>
<p>In today’s world of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, organisations are required to ensure that their investment is being spent as efficiently as possible. Blended learning, reduces the cost of travel and venue hire, but it also reduces the admin time associated with content distribution and reporting. The subsequent reduced physical training time also means less time out of the core business.</p>
<p>Flexibility is perhaps the strongest argument in favour of blended learning. It allows learners to access training and content at a time, place and pace that suits them and matches their needs. Learners can consume the information at their own pace and can go back to it when they need it.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that this form of learning improves information retention. Whilst face-to-face training is very useful in uplifting employee morale and encouraging collaboration, introducing e-learning elements allows learners to digest information at a pace that their comfortable with and gives them the option to revisit any parts of the syllabus that they may have initially struggled with. The option to determine the pace and to study in a perhaps more comfortable environment goes a long way to explaining why studies have shown that retention leaves of blended learning are around 25% compared to only 8-10% with traditional training.</p>
<h3>Scope & Challenges</h3>
<p>Blended learning solutions, though, do not come without their challenges. For instance, difficulty in acquiring new technology skills and the over-use of technology are issues that can already be observed. Resistance to organisational change might also pose a barrier to blended learning initiatives in some parts of the world.</p>
<p>Yet, in a world of ever-changing technology, it is perhaps inevitable that blended learning will become the new norm for professional development. Its benefits – cost effective, flexible – will increasingly outweigh barriers to entry, especially as virtual reality begins to enter the mainstream.</p>

    title: "Professional Training After Covid-19",
    description: `After Covid, are we going back to in-person training…… or is there something better that follows on from Virtual learning – Hybrid Learning?`,
    date: '1 May 2023',

      <h3>ICPS's Experience</h3>
<p>ICPS has been delivering high quality training for individuals and organisations in public service for over 20 years. We pride ourselves in being able to design training that balances academic rigour with practical experience. ICPS’s tried and tested learning content and our trainers are not just experts in learning but also practitioners in Policy, Governance, Parliament alongside all aspects Public Administration and have provided the very best in-person training throughout our operational history.</p>
<p>We have been at the forefront of delivering innovation in the learning space during this period. To put it in context public institutions been transitioning from ‘pencils to powerpoint’, moving the paper office to the digital office over a 40+ year trajectory. Distance digital communication and working has been a growing component of every work-place, public and private, in the 21st century. Recent events sped up this evolution, and ICPS which had invested heavily on internal innovation in this space, prototyping virtual courses and preparing virtual provision frameworks, was ready to seamlessly deploy them when needed.</p>
<p>We were delighted that when we transitioned our learning to a fully virtual model during the pandemic and through thoughtful learning design,managed to retain the excellent post course feedback to our schedule of “Virtual” courses.</p>
<p>Tracy Capald-Drewett, Executive Director commented “Customers have been asking, ‘what next’ following the pandemic? Is ICPS going back to In person Training? “ he also observed ” Prior to the global pandemic the public and commercial landscape had wildly differing approaches to virtual working. Many institutions, such as the EU and UK Civil Service, had embraced virtual working and had provided for it both in terms of digital infrastructure and contractual provision. Others, particularly financial services had significant compliance barriers to enabling a full roll out of virtual working provision. </p>
<p>Post covid the world is struggling with establishing the ‘new normal’, there are public and political calls for a ‘return to the office’ for public servants, many of whom had majority virtual working arrangements from before the pandemic! Whilst International Labour Force 2022 survey did show a growing trend in the physical return to the workplace across the world this was for the private sector. Civil service physical workplace participation rates remained below or at 50% of capacity for much of the OECD. Whilst this may be a permanent trend or just extended lag on working practices post-pandemic there is currently a significant demand for virtual provision.</p>
<p>With so much noise being made on the topic we feel that the answer is flexibility, we want to remove barriers to maximise participation and value attribution. Some clients may feel that there is a real or implied increasing mandate for physical attendance of events to justify training budgets and international networking obligations for their departments. “</p>
<h3>ICPS's Hybrid Approach</h3>
<p>In addressing this question, the ICPS dedicated learning & development team wanted to look at what has been learned over the last 20 and 3 years? Are there aspects of “Virtual” learning that can be applied to a new even more effective and impactful learning experience.</p>
<p>We certainly know the significant benefits of in-person training:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physically attending courses enables learners to form deeper personal connections with trainers and co-learners. This element of peer group social support can be critical for some learners who are struggling with components of a course.</li>
  <li>Forming study groups with like-minded learners and attending in-person promotes personal care and accountability in ways that virtual learning may not.</li>
  <li>Virtual learning models may lack social and emotional connection, there is a hard limit on how much the human mind can achieve from purely virtual human interaction</li>
  <li>Virtual training on Zoom or Teams can be challenging if learners have a propensity to keep cameras off during the learning where learners are unprepared or distracted, whereas attending in-person tends to see learners who arrive prepared to make progress rather than to merely check in for attendance</li>
  <li>Working with trainers and co-learners in-person also contributes to the development of professional soft skills in ways that virtual learning may not.</li>
  <li>In-person networking opportunities are almost always superior to virtual, the capacity to quickly ascertain shared beliefs, values or alignments between institutions and individuals can be far more rapidly found when supported by secondary and tertiary human communication signifiers (body language etc.) which are lost in the 2d communication space. </li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits from the “ Virtual” model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where the in-person learning model excels at fostering human interaction, the Virtual learning model thrives in facilitating flexibility and accessibility. It can be easier for busy professionals to balance travel, work, and a home/family life with a course that doesn’t require learners to travel and be totally away from the work place.</li>
  <li>Remote learning (especially a-synchronous remote learning) offers a level of flexibility that’s frankly unachievable for fully in-person programs.</li>
  <li>In-person training can face potential complications around accessibility:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You aren’t bound by geographical limits with fully remote Virtual Courses.</li>
    <li>In terms of accessibility, “Virtual” learning models offer an avenue for students who may be physically or financially unable to attend fully in-person courses.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Finally in-person training can throw up problems in relation to departmental delivery capacity:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>You can easily timetable ‘staggered’ attendance for groups from the same department meaning that not all capacity for a role is absorbed in training at one time.</li>
    <li>Or, on the inverse, this allows institutions to place departments on concurrent training pathways without have to ‘gap training’ provision to make sure there is available departmental capacity at all times. This prevents training mismatch between employees in the same/similar roles. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>The new ICPS ‘Hybrid approach’ offers a number of evolutionary benefits when compared to in-person or the virtual model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can have key departmental members attend for the networking aspects and bring other members of the team up to the same level of training via virtual.</li>
  <li>You can have virtual provision offered as a ‘fail over’ for travel related issues. International travel can and will be disrupted by geographical and geopolitical events, hybrid offers a guarantee that training will take place in the expected time period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracy continued “with what we have learnt, both from years delivering in-person courses and now a full schedule of very successful “Virtual” courses, it must be that we can provide an excellent learning experience that encompasses the benefits of both models. A solution that enables both learners to attend in-person and additionally, enables learners to also attend remotely if they either can't travel or they prefer learning remotely”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ICPS L&amp;D team have established how the new functionality available on virtual platforms such as Zoom can be incorporated in ICPS’s own technology platform, therefore enabling our course design to further enhance the learning experience of learners who want to learn both remotely and in-person as part of the ICPS Hybrid experience, with new features including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Switching slides/presentation control from trainer to course facilitator, enabling real focus on key learning points by the trainer</li>
  <li>The provision of live transcripts, specifically helpful where learners first language may not be English</li>
  <li>The new “Immersive view” of learners. This functionality brings together all the in-person learners into a single image on the platform</li>
  <li>The ability to utilise PowerPoint and Prezzipresentations as a backdrop for the trainer, which enables the trainer to signpost agenda items etc</li>
  <li>Noise suppression for remote learners</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracy concluded “We have already successfully delivered several pilots of the ICPS Hybrid approach and feedback has been excellent and we are now capable of delivering a Hybrid approach for our entire open course schedule. And additionally, are able to deliver a Hybrid approach for organisations who want courses specifically developed for groups of learners”</p>

    "title": "Enhancing Public Sector Service Delivery: The Importance of Tailored E-Learning",
    "description": "An exploration of how tailored e-learning programs can revolutionize public sector service delivery by equipping employees with necessary skills and knowledge.",
    "date": "22 Jan 2024",
    "content": `
        <p>The public sector is fundamental to our society. Collectively, it is the world’s largest service provider. Thus the skills of the workforce within the sector are critical to successfully delivering on a variety of social and economic priorities. However, as a result of technological and cultural changes, demographic shifts, and the ever-increasing movement of money, goods and people, the challenges facing the public sector are becoming even more complex. In such a context, public service workforces face numerous challenges, further escalating problems relating to public service delivery. Achieving excellence in service delivery requires not only efficient processes and effective policies but also a workforce equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge. For public organisations to remain competitive, they must therefore provide their employees with the relevant skills that will allow them to be creative and innovative members of their organisations, as well as enable them to contribute to excellence in service delivery.</p>
        
        <p>Organisational training is the answer to providing the necessary skills to the public sector workforce. The goal of such training programmes is to bridge the skill gap between the actual and desired job performance. However, the challenge in training lies in catering to a diverse range of employees with varying learning requirements within the organisation. Training programmes across the world have often suffered from ineffectiveness. Many such training programmes fail to produce the expected results because they are unable to meet the diverse needs of various employees within the organisation. To improve overall performance, a strategic approach to training becomes indispensable. Recognising the workforce’s heterogeneity, it is critical to use tailored training methodologies that resonate with different segments of the audience. Diversity is inherent in public service organisations, which includes individuals from various backgrounds, experiences, and job roles. Therefore, a one-size-fits-all training approach falls short of accommodating the unique learning needs and preferences of employees. Organisations can foster a more inclusive learning environment by utilising a mix of training mediums tailored to different segments of the workforce.</p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="/img/articles/elearning2.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
        </div>

        <p>As one of the world’s largest public sector training organisation, ICPS believes in creating training programmes that can cater to the needs of every single employee in an organisation. ICPS’s portfolio of courses includes 1 – 5-day accredited courses with the option of in-person, virtual as well as “hybrid” delivery. Considering how pressed for time and resources public servants often are, we have also now introduced a range of online (eLearning) courses. These courses are offered at introductory, intermediate and mastery levels, fulfilling the needs of employees at all levels of a public sector organisation. With over 20 years of experience, ICPS is uniquely positioned to share know-how and identify emerging trends in best practice from which public sector organisations may be able to benefit.</p>
        
        <h3>The Power of E-Learning in Public Sector Training</h3>
        <p>While different forms of training serve unique purposes, e-learning emerges as a versatile and potent tool that can effectively address the multifaceted training requirements within public service organisations. E-learning offers unparalleled advantages, serving as an instrumental medium to reach and engage the largest section of employees within an organisation. ICPS’s e-learning courses are designed in a way that they are flexible, scalable, and accessible, making them ideal for delivering training content to a diverse audience spread across geographical locations and time zones. </p>
        
        <p>Courses such as ‘Effective Writing Skills (EWS) for the Public Service’ are ideal for frontline workers whose schedules are often packed and demanding. These concise and targeted sessions cater to their need for quick, on-the-go access to relevant information, ensuring minimal disruption to their operational duties. Managers, tasked with supervisory responsibilities, might benefit from courses within our ‘The Successful Managers Toolkits for the Public Service.’ These courses focus on leadership skills in public service, which are critical for improving organisational performance and service delivery. While our e-learning programme on ‘Innovation and Change for Success in the Public Service’, is well suited for people at the leadership level. This programme not only imparts advanced skills but also fosters an environment where high-level strategies can be addressed and refined.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
          <img src="/img/articles/elearning3.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
        </div>

        <h3>Impact on Organisational Performance</h3>
        <p>Thus e-learning as a medium of training allows the learner to leverage technology to personalise learning experiences. The benefits of e-learning extend beyond individual skill enhancement; they have a profound impact on organisational performance. By equipping employees with relevant and up-to-date knowledge, public service entities can enhance operational efficiency thereby improving service delivery which ultimately, increases stakeholder satisfaction. Furthermore, harnessing the potential of e-learning to cater to the diverse learning needs within public service organisations is pivotal for fostering a culture of continuous improvement and superior service delivery. Embracing a tailored approach to training and utilising the right training mediums for different segments of the workforce, ensures that every individual contributes optimally toward the organisation's overarching goals. </p>

    "description": "A comprehensive overview of the need for agility and innovation in public services to address evolving societal, economic, and technological trends.",
    "date": "14 May 2024",
    "content": `
      <p>The world is fundamentally changing with massive shifts in demographic, societal, economic, and technological trends that are shaping our future. Citizens' needs and demands are also evolving, and the public sector globally has to become more agile and innovative to keep pace with this rapidly changing world. However, public service organisations are often seen to be resistant to transformation. Many public service organisations around the world seek to increase capacity but not transform. However, to stay relevant in the future these organisations must innovate and transform regardless of whether they operate in healthcare, justice, education, central or local government.</p>
      
      <p>There are several compelling reasons to pursue transformation in public service:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced efficiency and cost savings:</strong> Many public sector agencies are burdened by manual processes, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs. Relevant transformation can streamline operations, automate tasks and save taxpayer money.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved service delivery:</strong> Citizens expect government services to be accessible and efficient. A transformed public sector can lead to improved service delivery and greater citizen satisfaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Better decision-making:</strong> Transformation enables better data collection and analysis, which helps inform the decision-making process. This can lead to more informed policy decisions and resource allocation.</li>
        <li><strong>Citizen engagement and accountability:</strong> Transformation enables better citizen engagement, making it easier for citizens to access information and interact with government agencies, thus increasing accountability.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>However, transformation in public service is complex and requires careful planning and guidance in transitioning from existing practices to new improved ones. By definition transformation involves change and yet the introduction of change management strategies and methods in the public services are often resisted, citing the lack of precise definitions of their nature and the uncertainty of their outcomes within change programmes. ICPS's extensive pedigree in building capacity in the public service means that we understand the challenges of transformation and change and to that end have developed a programme of courses that support the success factors for transformation.</p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/img/articles/transformation2.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
      </div>

      <p>Organisational transformation is hard to conceptualise for public service organisations and harder to apply. However, experience tells us the success of transformation is dependent upon the presence of the following factors: 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Committed Leadership with Clear Purpose and Priorities:</strong> Successful transformations are driven by motivated leaders who have a clear purpose and priorities to achieve the targeted outcomes. Committed leaders who display determination as well as adaptability are the most important factors for ensuring successful transformation and for ensuring that the change is resilient to future shocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Compelling Communication and Visioning:</strong> A compelling future vision, communicated to teams by visible leaders, is a key component of successful transformation. However, such communication channels need to be omnidirectional which not only gives leaders new ways to communicate with employees but also opens up new mechanisms to listen and demonstrate authenticity. In the organisational context, including openness and transparency with key stakeholders is essential.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating Capability for Change:</strong> Creating capacity for change involves equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources to navigate and adapt to transformational initiatives successfully. This process encompasses investing in learning and development programmes, fostering a culture of openness and innovation, and empowering employees to embrace new challenges. By building capacity for change, organisations can enhance their resilience, agility, and ability to thrive in dynamic environments, ultimately driving sustainable growth and achieving strategic objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination in Service Delivery:</strong> Fostering highly collaborative teams and a central point of coordination significantly improves the success of Transformation programs, often using agile approaches such as cross-functional teams.</li>
        <li><strong>Building resilience to the challenges of the future:</strong> One of the clearest lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic is that it is very difficult for public service organisations to anticipate how future changes might impact their transformation programmes. Indeed, increasing global uncertainties driven by the current geopolitical and other unforeseen events underline the importance of building resilience in the public service.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Barriers to Transformation</h3>

      <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/img/articles/transformation3.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
      </div>
      
      <p>Many public service employees are often seen to remain resistant to change which often hampers the transformation initiatives. It is often claimed that public service employees may ignore innovation and prefer to carry on doing things in the same old way. Moreover, the risk-averse nature of public service organisations can create barriers to change, learning and transformation.</p>
      
      <p>Similarly, public organisations are often seen as being reluctant to invest in change that could potentially create longer-term benefits as there are immediate pressures to realise benefits from as low an input cost as possible. Moreover, the ongoing spending cuts across the globe have created an environment where organisations are more risk-averse. Reductions in staff numbers have led to an environment where there are fewer people available to implement and support transformation. There has also been greater emphasis on protecting core services rather than trying to do things differently.</p>
      
      <p>Organisational learning if undertaken widely can help overcome some of these barriers to transformation. Learning can help widen horizons and identify that there are different and better ways of doing things. Therefore learning and development have to be central in helping people both understand the need for transformation, cope with its effects and thrive from the benefits the change brings.</p>
      
      <p>The following case study depicts some challenges and ways they were overcome when transforming public service:</p>
      
      <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">

      </div>

      <p>In Brazil, where poverty and inequality were significant challenges, the implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme, Bolsa Família (launched in 2003), revolutionised social welfare policies. Traditional welfare programmes were fragmented, inefficient, and often failed to reach those most in need. Bolsa Família sought to address these shortcomings by introducing a comprehensive and targeted approach to social assistance.</p>
      
      <p>Challenges: 
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of staff training:</strong> Brazil's social welfare system was fragmented, with multiple programmes administered by different government agencies. These agencies were provided with no proper training in achieving the desired outcomes. This lack of direction and training often resulted in poor implementation of the programmes including duplication of efforts and inefficiencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Resistance:</strong> Implementing Bolsa Família required overcoming political resistance from various stakeholders, including opposition parties, traditional elites, and bureaucratic interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Coordinating data from disparate sources and ensuring accurate targeting of beneficiaries posed a significant challenge in a country with diverse socio-economic conditions and geographic disparities.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Planning and Strategy:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training programmes for the staff:</strong> In its first phase of implementation of Bolsa Família encompassed integrating multiple existing cash transfer programmes and investing in learning and development programmes. The training was focused on creating motivated leaders who have a clear purpose and priorities to achieve the targeted outcomes. The training also prioritised creating capacity for change involves equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources to navigate and adapt to transformational initiatives successfully. The training played a huge role in reducing corruption and duplication and increasing efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted Approach:</strong> Bolsa Família adopted a targeted approach to social assistance, focusing on the poorest and most vulnerable families, identified through a rigorous process of socio-economic assessment.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation:</strong> Bolsa Família implemented robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track programme implementation, assess impact, and ensure transparency and accountability.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Change Management:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Training:</strong> Bolsa Família’s focus on organisational training helped bring in the much-needed efficiency which was essential for the successful implementation of the scheme.</li>

    "title": "ICPS eLearning: Revolutionising Public Service Training Globally",
    "description": "An overview of how ICPS eLearning solutions are transforming public service training, offering flexible, cost-effective, and comprehensive learning experiences for global workforces.",
    "date": "22 July 2024",
    "content": `

      <p>While Learning and Development (L&D) is important for all sectors, it could be argued that this is especially the case when it comes to public service organisations who are being asked to do even more while facing dwindling budgets. Emphasis is being placed on teams being able to do more with fewer and fewer resources. Moreover, with a large number of staff, diverse geographical spread, numerous departments and functions, and complex training needs, it should come as no surprise that Government departments across the world are facing challenging training requirements. It is therefore critical that public service organisations implement efficient solutions to streamline the task of effective training of their staff. In today's world of rapid advancements in technology, the best way to achieve this would be to opt for eLearning.</p>
  
      <p>While eLearning might be commonly perceived as delivering training online, its scope extends far beyond that. An e-learning training solution is perfect for any Government organisation because it can significantly reduce costs and time for nearly every L&D initiative. In addition, it can play a critical role in helping public service organisations ensure that their staff receive relevant training which is scalable to fit any number of users.</p>
  
      <p>Some common issues faced by Government organisations for the training of their employees where eLearning is well suited:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased job complexities and consequent capability gaps in the workforce</li>
        <li>Large number of employees, with different functions and responsibilities, in varying departments</li>
        <li>The perpetual need for upskilling of all employees</li>
        <li>Effective management of cost-effectiveness and time constraints faced by organisations serving the public</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>It is for this reason that public service organisations across the world are increasingly turning to innovative eLearning solutions to train their workforce. The Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) launched by the U.S. government, for instance, invests in the next generation of African leaders while the UK's National Health Service's (NHS) emphasis is on clinical skills and patient care. Leading institutions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the World Health Organization (WHO), are embracing the power of eLearning.</p>
  
      <p>ICPS's eLearning solutions stand at the forefront of this revolution, offering a comprehensive, flexible, and cost-effective solution to the broad requirements of organisations in public service.</p>
  
      <p>ICPS offers both a library of pre-built e-learning courses as well as the capability to develop eLearning for specific custom needs</p>
  
      <p>Our pre-built Library courses cover topics such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Leading for Success in the Public Service"</li>
        <li>"Managing for Success in the Public Service"</li>
        <li>"Effective Writing Skills for the Public Service"</li>
        <li>"Introduction to Effective Strategic Policy Planning in the Public Service"</li>
        <li>"Advanced Public Financial Management"</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>While our diverse range of courses ensures that all public sector professionals, from emerging leaders to seasoned managers, can develop the competencies needed to drive positive change we understand that specific needs might still arise. Thus over and above the rich library of eLearning courses, ICPS can develop custom eLearning for specific customer needs. By providing custom courses, our eLearning caters to individual and organisational needs and preferences making learning a personalised journey much like the U.S. government's YALI programme.</p>
  
      <h2>Flexible, Accessible Learning for a Global Workforce</h2>

      <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/img/articles/globaltraining/image2.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
      </div>
  
      <p>One of the greatest advantages of eLearning is that it allows learners to learn at their own pace and in the comfort of their own surroundings. This advantage of the self-paced learning was successfully employed by organisations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The IMF successfully made use of e-learning's flexibility to train their employees spread across 190 countries, while the World Bank made use of the self-paced feature. Similarly, ICPS's eLearning allows participants to learn at their own pace and from any location they may be at. Our online platform ensures accessibility from anywhere, at any time, breaking down geographical barriers and reaching learners even in areas with limited infrastructure. This flexibility is crucial for public sector professionals balancing demanding work schedules with the need for continuous professional development.</p>
  
      <h2>Interactive, Engaging Content for Enhanced Retention</h2>
  
      <p>ICPS's dynamic eLearning includes engaging quizzes, relevant case studies, and post-course testing and certification providing an immersive learning experience, high engagement and strong knowledge retention. This format helps not only in capturing learners' attention but also in deepening their understanding, resulting in enhanced performance which is crucial for public service professionals.</p>
  
      <h2>Cost-Effective Solution for Resource-Constrained Environments</h2>
  
      <p>eLearning has provided considerable savings across all major public organisations training budgets. It is undeniable that traditional in-person training provides an excellent learning experience, however, if you have a large cohort cost can be prohibitive. So with large cohorts eLearning can be a lot more cost-effective both in terms of direct costs such as travel and accommodation but also the indirect time of staff away from workflows. With a large cohort and lots of geographical locations, eLearning was the natural choice for the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
  
      <h2>Real-World Relevance and Practical Application</h2>
  
      <p>For any learning intervention, whether traditional classroom-based or eLearning subject/content expertise in relation to the application is vital. ICPS ensures that not only our traditional courses but also our eLearning designers draw from their expertise in delivering solutions for extensive projects within public service. This level of experience/ expertise, similarly, is clearly demonstrated within the IMF eLearning where it was essential to cite real-world economic policy making.</p>
  
      <h2>Recognition and Motivation through Digital Credentials</h2>

      <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/img/articles/globaltraining/image3.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
      </div>
  
      <p>In support of learners professional development, ICPS awards certification/completion badges upon successful course completion, serving as tangible recognition of achievement. Similar to the certificates offered by YALI or the World Bank's Open Learning Campus, these badges motivate learners and provide credible proof of their newly acquired skills, potentially enhancing their professional prospects.</p>
  
      <h2>Supporting Mandatory Training and Compliance</h2>
  
      <p>The NHS UK uses its eLearning platform to ensure staff complete mandatory training. Similarly, ICPS eLearning solutions can be leveraged to track and ensure compliance with essential public service standards and regulations. Our system of completion badges provides tangible proof of course completion, supporting organisations in maintaining high standards of service delivery and our platform provides the vital evidence of compliance.</p>
  
      <h2>Continuous Professional Development in a Rapidly Changing World</h2>

      <div style="text-align: center; padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <img src="/img/articles/globaltraining/image4.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">
      </div>
  
      <p>Like the UN Development Programme's approach, ICPS eLearning supports ongoing professional development. Our wide range of courses allows public service professionals to continually update their skills and knowledge, ensuring they remain at the forefront of best practices in their fields.</p>
  
      <p>Thus eLearning stands as a transformative force in the world of public service organisational training. Its advantages, from enhanced engagement to continuous professional development have a profound impact on both learners and organisations. By embracing ICPS's eLearning solutions you can create a dynamic and efficient learning environment that keeps pace with the demands of the rapidly changing world.

    "title": "The Imperative of Upskilling and Reskilling in the UK Public Sector",
    "description": "Discover why upskilling and reskilling are critical for the UK's public sector workforce and how they ensure adaptability, resilience, and future-readiness.",
    "date": "15 Jan 2025",
    "content": `
        <p>In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, demographic shifts, and evolving societal needs, the demand for a skilled workforce has never been greater. The UK public sector, pivotal to delivering efficient services to citizens, must address significant skills gaps to remain effective and future-ready. Upskilling and reskilling efforts are critical to achieving this goal and ensuring resilience in the face of ongoing challenges.</p>
        <h3 id="a-national-skills-crisis">A National Skills Crisis</h3>
        <p>Recent reports underscore the urgency of addressing skills shortages in the UK. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) highlights that the UK workforce faces chronic skills gaps in high-demand areas like digital technology, manufacturing, and life sciences. These deficits are particularly pronounced in the public sector, where evolving service delivery models demand new competencies.</p>
        <p>Adding to this urgency, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has called for a more cohesive approach to workforce development, emphasizing that current skills programs may fall short of addressing the country's pressing needs. This challenge is compounded by the ongoing impact of global crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the adoption of digital tools and hybrid work environments.</p>
        <h3 id="why-upskilling-and-reskilling-matter">Why Upskilling and Reskilling Matter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adapting to Technological Change:</strong> The rapid integration of artificial intelligence, big data, and cybersecurity solutions demands that public sector employees acquire technical expertise. Without these skills, organizations risk falling behind in service delivery and operational efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosting Productivity and Efficiency:</strong> Equipping employees with updated skills ensures that tasks are performed effectively, reducing resource wastage and improving service outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensuring Organizational Resilience:</strong> The public sector’s ability to adapt to unforeseen challenges, such as global pandemics or economic disruptions, hinges on a workforce capable of learning and applying new skills quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhancing Public Trust:</strong> A skilled public service workforce is better equipped to meet citizen expectations, thus building confidence in government institutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="strategies-for-effective-workforce-development">Strategies for Effective Workforce Development</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Leverage Technology-Enhanced Learning:</strong> Platforms like the ICPS SkillWise offer scalable solutions that combine data-driven insights with customizable training paths. These platforms enable public sector organizations to monitor progress and adapt learning programs to individual needs.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on Lifelong Learning:</strong> Encouraging a culture of continuous education and professional development helps employees stay ahead in their fields and prepares them for future roles. The UK apprenticeship levy, for instance, has been identified as a tool to help organizations adapt to the AI-driven economy.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborate Across Sectors:</strong> Partnerships with private entities and academic institutions can bridge gaps in expertise, offering access to cutting-edge knowledge and resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Invest in Leadership Development:</strong> Effective leadership is critical to fostering a culture of innovation and adaptability. Training leaders to manage change ensures that they can guide their teams through transitions effectively.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="success-stories-and-lessons">Success Stories and Lessons</h3>
        <p>The UK's Conditional Cash Transfer program, Bolsa Família, exemplifies the transformative potential of well-executed upskilling initiatives. By investing in training for staff and leaders, the program addressed inefficiencies and improved service delivery, offering a model for similar efforts in other sectors.</p>
        <h3 id="the-way-forward">The Way Forward</h3>
        <p>As highlighted in recent news, the UK government has pledged to "fire up" workforce training programs to address pressing economic challenges. However, this commitment must translate into actionable strategies that integrate technology, foster collaboration, and prioritize continuous learning.</p>
        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Upskilling and reskilling are no longer optional in the UK public sector; they are strategic imperatives. With the right investments in training, technology, and leadership, public service organizations can build a resilient, adaptable workforce capable of meeting the demands of a rapidly changing world. As organizations like ICPS demonstrate, scalable, technology-driven learning solutions are key to equipping employees with the skills they need to thrive in the future.</p>
